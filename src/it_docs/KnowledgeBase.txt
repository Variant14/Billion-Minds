KB-001 — VPN authentication fails after password reset

    ID: KB-001
    Category: network
    Pattern:
        “VPN authentication failed; password works for email; MFA prompt not showing or failing.”

    Summary:
        Typical VPN failures after a password change are caused by cached credentials or outdated VPN profiles on the client.

    Resolution Steps:

        Ask user to close the VPN client completely (including tray).
        Remove VPN/domain entries from Windows Credential Manager.
        Sign out/in of Microsoft 365 desktop apps.
        Delete old VPN profile.
        Import latest VPN config file.
        Trigger MFA re-registration if prompts fail.
        Reconnect and verify access (Jira/Git).
        If still failing, gather logs and escalate.
